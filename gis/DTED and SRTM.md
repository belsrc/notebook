DTED is the elevation from true ground. While, SRTM is the elevation from vegetation tops.

The DTED format for level 0, 1 and 2 is described in U.S. Military Specification Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) MIL-PRF-89020B, and amongst other parameters describes the resolution for each level:

- Level 0 has a post spacing of approximately 900 meters.
- Level 1 has a post spacing of approximately 90 meters.
- Level 2 has a post spacing of approximately 30 meters.
