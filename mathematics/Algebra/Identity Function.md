An identity function, also called an identity relation, identity map or identity transformation, is a function that always returns the value that was used as its argument, unchanged. When $f$ is the identity function, the equality $f(x) = x$ is true for all values of $x$ to which $f$ can be applied.

## Definition

Formally, if $X$ is a set, the identity function $f$ on $X$ is defined to be a function with $X$ as its domain and codomain, satisfying:

$f(x) = x \ \forall\  x \in X$

The identity function $f$ on $X$ is often denoted by $id_X$.

## Algebraic Properties

If $f : X \to Y$ is any function, then $f \circ id_X = f = id_X$. In particular, $id_X$ is the identity element of the monoid of all functions from $X$ to $X$ (under composition). Since the identity element of a monoid is unique, one can alternatively define the identity function on $M$ to be this identity element. Such a definition generalizes to the concept of an identity morphism in category theory, where the endomorphisms of $M$ need not be functions.

## Properties

- The identity function is a linear operator when applied to vector spaces.

- In an n-dimensional vector space the identity function is represented by the identity matrix $I_{n\prime}$ regardless of the basis chosen for the space.

- The identity function on the positive integers is a completely multiplicative function (essentially multiplication by 1), considered in number theory.

- In a metric space the identity function is trivially an isometry. An object without any symmetry has as its symmetry group he trivial group containing only this isometry.

- In a topological space, the identity function is always continuous.

- The identity function is idempotent.
