A binary operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands does not change the result. It is a fundamental property of many binary operations. Perhaps most familiar as a property of arithmetic $3 + 4 = 4 + 3$ or $2 \times 5 = 5 \times 2$. There are operations, such as division and subtraction, that do not have it. For example, $3 - 5 = 5 - 3$; such operations are not commutative and so are referred to as noncommutative operations.

A similar property exists for binary relations; a binary relation is said to be symmetric if the relation applies regardless of the order or its operands; for example, equality is symmetric as two equal mathematical objects are equal regardless of their order.

## Definition

A binary operation $\cdot$ on a set $S$ is called commutative if:
$$
x * y = y * x \;\;\;\forall\: x,y \in S
$$
In other words, an operation is commutative if every two elements commute. An operation that does not satisfy the above property is called noncommutative.

One says $\text{x commutes with y}$ or that $\text{x and y commute}$ under $*$ if:
$$
x * y = y * x
$$

## Operations

- Addition and multiplication are commutative in most number systems.
- Addition is commutative in every vector space and in every algebra.
- Union and intersection are commutative operations on sets.
- "And" and "or" are commutative in logical operations.

## Non-commutative Operations

- Division: $1 \div 2 \neq 2 \div 1$
- Subtraction: $0 - 1 \neq 1 - 0$. It is more precisely classified as anti-commutative: $0 - 1 = -(1 - 0)$
- Exponentiation: $2^3 \neq 3^2$

## Truth Functional Connectives

Commutativity is a property of some logical connectives of truth-functional propositional logic. The following logical equivalences demonstrate that commutativity is a property of particular connectives. The following are truth-functional tautologies.

#### Commutativity of conjunction
$$
(P \:\wedge\: Q) \leftrightarrow (Q \:\wedge\: P)
$$
#### Commutativity of disjunction
$$
(P \:\vee\: Q) \leftrightarrow (Q \:\vee\: P)
$$
#### Commutativity of Implication
$$
(P \to (Q \to R)) \leftrightarrow (Q \to (P \to R))
$$
#### Commutativity of equivalence
$$
(P \:\leftrightarrow\: Q) \leftrightarrow (Q \:\leftrightarrow\: P)
$$

## Mathematical Structures and Commutativity

- A commutative semigroup is a set endowed with a total, associative and commutative operation.
- If the operation additionally has an identity element, we have a commutative monoid.
- An abelian group, or commutative group is a group whose group operation is commutative.
