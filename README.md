# Notebook

A technical notebook containing notes, research, and references accumulated through software engineering work and self-study. Topics span computer science fundamentals, data formats, mathematics, and related domains.

## Contents

This repository covers:

- **Computer Science**: Data structures, CPU branching, memory layout, programming paradigms
- **Data Formats**: Apache Arrow, GeoJSON, Protocol Buffers
- **Mathematics**: Algebra, geometry, linear algebra
- Additional software engineering topics and mathematical foundations

Each note includes citations and source attribution in its front matter.

## Usage

These notes were written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and make extensive use of LaTeX for mathematical notation. **GitHub's Markdown renderer has limited LaTeX support and may not display equations correctly.**

### Recommended Viewing

For the best experience, clone this repository and open it in:
- **Obsidian** (recommended)
- Any Markdown editor with full LaTeX support

### GitHub Web Viewing

Many equations and mathematical expressions will not render properly in GitHub's web interface due to:
- Stripped or escaped LaTeX symbols
- Limited support for inline math and display blocks
- Inconsistent rendering of complex expressions
