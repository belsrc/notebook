One of my Obsidian vaults focused around software engineering learning and notes.

As mentioned these were written in Obsidian that has normal LaTeX support. Due to Github stripping certain symbols and requiring arbitrary blocks, some things will not render correctly.

As such, I highly recommend view in Obsidian or another editor that has proper support.
