**unary** → single arg

**curry** → function arg chaining / closure

**composition** → composition (even oop should know composition)

**HOF** → HOF (HOF should be common since React says HOC)

**lenses** → accessors → getters/setters

**functors/monads** → interfaces/control structures

**purity** → Deterministic, Idempotency, Referential Transparency









Benefits of purity:

Perfect, predictable caching of return values
Easier debugging
Perfect parallelization


Pure code should have one output for one input.
Should cause no external side-effects
Should return a value (see #1)
